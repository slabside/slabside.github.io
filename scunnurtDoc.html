                        <p>This song is one of Scunnurts old original songs that has been released for a couple of years now.
                            This song is a high energy punk song which is fast and catchy.
                            We felt that it was a good song to start off with as it is a song that grabs the audience’s attention due to the tempo, the loud shouting vocals and solid guitar parts.</p>

                        <h4 class="media-heading">I Feel Pretty</h4>
                        <p>This song is an original song that is a bit more recent. This song seems to match the first that we play as it is another high tempo punk song which is why we played this second, to follow up on the same level of energy. This song also has catchy lyrics in the chorus which I think also helps with making it easier for the audience to listen.</p>

                        <p>This song is a bit different from the others. This song is in the time signature of 13/16, and it is an instrumental. We threw this in the set as a bit of a curveball. After playing 2 fast punk songs, we thought it would be good to switch it up. We also done this because we felt at the time that it was the direction that the band was going in</p>

                        <h4 class="media-heading">Technosexual</h4>
                        <p>This next song is a fusion of funk and heavy alternative music. It is another strange song which seems to define us as a band. We placed this in the set here to bring back the energy although it is not fast, but it is loud and grabs the audience’s attention once again.</p>

                        <h4 class="media-heading">Limbs</h4>
                        <p>Limbs is the first song that Scunnurt ever wrote with a prominent synth part. The synth in this song is the main factor and carries it right from the start. This was us as a band again experimenting with our sound ad pushing the limits of our creativity. We placed this near the end because it ended up becoming one of the bands personal favourites and they wanted to show that putting it as one of the last in the set.</p>

                        <h4 class="media-heading">Magic Man</h4>
                        <p>This song is one of the fan favourites and it once again has great energy but it isn’t so high in tempo. The dynamics of this song are really good as we mange to go from really loud in the chorus to bring it right down in the verses. This felt like a good choice placing it here in the set.</p>

                        <p>Cream Kravitz is our oldest song that people seem to like the most after listening to us for a while from where we started. Although all of us as a band are fed up of this song. We felt it was necessary to put in the set as it is most likely are most well known song</p>

                        <p>Orange Peel is the title track of newest EP that Scunnurt put out and we felt it was the strongest song no the EP by far. We also love to play it live and when we do, we play it well in most cases. This is why we finished the set off with this one cause we felt it was the strongest song to play and people seem to like it.</p>
