                <h2>A Drummer Born</h2>
                <p>A drummer, I am currently playing in three bands and have played in different venues across Scotland.
                    I started playing drums when I was 10 and was in my first band at 11. That band, Scunnurt, is still together today.
                <p>As well as my own band involvement, I have also filled in on drums for a variety contemporary acts such as: Bitter Suite and Leisureland, as well as cover bands over the years.
                    These acts have different styles of music, Bitter Suite being up-tempo indie pop music and Leisure land being more relaxed indie music. I have experience of other styles of music as well
                    having done live sessions with Americana band King of Birds and Sound of Lies who are a less known country / rock band.
                    A highlight of my younger years was when i accompanied American singer-songwriter Willie Nile and his bandmate Johnnie Pisano (Johnnie Pi) on cajon where we performed
                    5 of tracks in Lochbarr venue in Lochwinnoch.
                <p>I have taken part in various recording sessions notably Scunnurts Orange Peel EP, which led to some interest from student record label Electric Honey for whom we are headlining the Electric Honey showcase
                    in Stereo (Glasgow) early in June
                <p>A recent mini-tour with Scunnurt saw the band travel to Inverness to play Hootananny, Aberdeen's Tunnels and the Attic in Glasgow.
                    I am also a full time member in bands The Rants and Home for Joy. Both bands are in the early stages with The Rants having played a few gigs in venues Legends in Edinburgh,
                    The Bungalow in Paisley and Broadcast in Glasgow. We are currently recording 6 tracks for an EP titled "You're always so busy (being make believe)" which
                    we hope will be released mid-summer.
                    Home for Joy have their first gig coming up in Room 2, Glasgow and have gigs planned for the future.
                <p>I'm hoping that my involvement with a diverse range of bands and styles to date will stand me in good stead to become good session musician.
