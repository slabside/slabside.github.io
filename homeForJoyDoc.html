            <p>Home for joy is the college band I am in. This meant on the lead up to this gig we would do 2 rehearsals a week for most weeks on Tuesdays and Thursday afternoons. We had been practising our set since the start of the college year, which was August, so we had a lot of time for practising to make sure that we were as we got assessed.</p>

                        <p>We all decided to start with our own song “Heaven Knows” because of the fast tempo and the energy of it which helped us to catch the audience’s attention. We also chose this song because we as a band agree that it is one of the best songs that we play and that it would be good to give our set a strong start. It was also good to put this song first because we feel as a band that it gives us a boost since it’s one of our favourite songs in the set.</div>

                        <h4 class="media-heading">Where is My Mind</h4>
                        <p>We chose to play this song because we are all a big fan of this band and song. We also picked it because of its popularity so that the audience would know it and hopefully engage them more into our performance. Since we all enjoy playing this there wasn’t a problem in enjoying the moment.</p>

                        <p>This tune was newly added to the set but was simple enough for us to learn and perform it. Since it was new, we weren’t bored of it and I think we can all agree that it’s one of our best. Since the song doesn’t have a lot of chords and a basic drum beat, the song is easier for us to enjoy as a band which gave us time to show some stage presence. The song is also lively and up beat which brings back the energy after a slow tune.</p>

                        <p>This song is another slow song that is very popular. We chose to play this song because of our love for Radiohead and because we thought it would impress the audience with our skill and musicianship as it is a hard song to pull off. We also thought it was a good idea to play a slow one because it sets up the bug ending for our next song.</p>

                        <p>We chose to play this song last because it is another original and it is our favourite song to play. We thought that this song would be great to end on because of the dramatic crescendo in the song. We also thought that playing another original would show off our writing skills and showing our knowledge of dynamics.</p>
