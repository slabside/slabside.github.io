            <p>The Rants rehearse in Raptor studios in Johnstone on Sundays for three hours usually 10-1. The schedule for this gig was a bit mixed up because of some members being busy with their own personal business the days we would’ve rehearsed for this gig leading up to it would’ve been:
                12/3/23 – 19/3/22 -  26/3/23

                        <p>Forget is one of the first songs we wrote as a band and felt it would be good to start off the set with this because of its high tempo and energy. The people that come to see us play seem to like this song because of those reasons, so we decided to start with it so that they enjoyed our performance from the start</p></div>

                        <h4 class="media-heading">Call My Name</h4>
                        <p>This song is a bit slower than the first but has a cool and slick drumbeat with catchy guitar parts and solid basslines. This did sort of switch up the vibe of the set but it was still a high energy song that had the audience jumping.</p>

                        <p>Roman Holiday was the only cover that we had done in the set. This song is by a band called Fontaines D.C. We chose to cover this song as it is well known by the people that come to our gigs and they all very much enjoy this song.</p>

                        <p>This song takes us back to our originals with a jumpy off beat drumbeat and a very hooky guitar line which make this a summer song that we are proud of. We’ve been told that this is one of our best songs and we seem to agree so it felt appropriate to place it here in the set.</p>

                        <p>This is a song that I come off the drum kit for and sing. It is a song that I wrote, and we decided to put it in the set because of the fact I have lots of energy when I am off the drum kit and out front on the stage, so we felt to bring some stage presence, it was necessary to do so.</p>

                        <h4 class="media-heading">What is a Man</h4>
                        <p>This song is the sort of song that builds up right until the end of the song, so it keeps getting louder and louder as it goes on. We decided to add this in because it is a strong song that is powerful because of its different parts on each instrument.</p>

                        <p>You’re always so busy is like What is a man in terms of its structure. It’s another that is bit of a climax and gets louder as it goes on. We felt that it was a good idea to end the set with this song because it is a real powerhouse tune and is another one of the songs that the fans seem to like.</p>
